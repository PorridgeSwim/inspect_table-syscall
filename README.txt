This file should contain:

-You Zhou yz3883	Your name & UNI (or those of all group members for group assignments)
-HW4	Homework assignment number
-	Description for each part

Part1, part2 is easy but takes a lot of time.
Part3 is the most difficult part, and I think the provided information is not enought, but I solved these problems after going to OH.
Part4,5,6 are relatively easy, we just need to type some codes, which thing that I am more used to do.

The description should indicate whether your solution for the part is working
or not. You may also want to include anything else you would like to
communicate to the grader, such as extra functionality you implemented or how
you tried to fix your non-working code.
